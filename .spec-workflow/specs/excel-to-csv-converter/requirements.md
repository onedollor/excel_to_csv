# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Excel-to-CSV converter is an automated data processing tool that monitors configurable folders for Excel files and intelligently extracts worksheet data as CSV files. The system uses confidence-based analysis to determine when worksheets contain meaningful data tables (90% confidence threshold) and automatically converts them to CSV format. This tool streamlines data processing workflows by eliminating manual Excel-to-CSV conversion tasks while ensuring data integrity and avoiding empty or non-tabular worksheet processing.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature provides automated data processing capabilities that reduce manual intervention in data workflows. By implementing intelligent worksheet analysis, the tool ensures high-quality data extraction while maintaining processing efficiency. The configurable folder monitoring approach allows users to seamlessly integrate the converter into existing data pipelines.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Configurable Folder Monitoring

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to configure specific folders to monitor for Excel files, so that I can automate the processing of files from different data sources without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a folder path THEN the system SHALL validate the path exists and is accessible
2. WHEN a user adds a folder to monitor THEN the system SHALL continuously watch for new .xlsx and .xls files
3. WHEN multiple folders are configured THEN the system SHALL monitor all folders simultaneously
4. WHEN a configuration file is provided THEN the system SHALL load folder paths from the configuration
5. WHEN folder monitoring starts THEN the system SHALL process existing Excel files and monitor for new ones

### Requirement 2: Intelligent Data Table Detection

**User Story:** As a data processor, I want the system to automatically detect worksheets containing data tables with 90% confidence, so that I avoid processing empty sheets or non-tabular content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing a worksheet THEN the system SHALL calculate confidence score based on data density, header patterns, and data consistency
2. WHEN confidence score reaches 90% or higher THEN the system SHALL mark the worksheet for CSV conversion
3. WHEN confidence score is below 90% THEN the system SHALL skip the worksheet and log the reason
4. WHEN detecting headers THEN the system SHALL identify potential column headers in the first few rows
5. WHEN analyzing data patterns THEN the system SHALL detect consistent data types within columns

### Requirement 3: Excel File Processing

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to read Excel files from monitored folders and extract all qualifying worksheets, so that I can convert complex Excel workbooks into separate CSV files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an Excel file is detected THEN the system SHALL open and analyze all worksheets
2. WHEN a worksheet passes the confidence threshold THEN the system SHALL extract all data including headers
3. WHEN extracting data THEN the system SHALL preserve original data formatting and cell values
4. WHEN processing fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue with remaining worksheets
5. WHEN file is locked or inaccessible THEN the system SHALL retry after a configurable delay

### Requirement 4: CSV File Generation

**User Story:** As a data consumer, I want qualifying worksheets to be converted to CSV files with meaningful names, so that I can easily identify and use the extracted data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating CSV files THEN the system SHALL use format: {original_filename}_{worksheet_name}.csv
2. WHEN writing CSV data THEN the system SHALL properly escape special characters and handle commas in cell values
3. WHEN output folder is specified THEN the system SHALL save CSV files to the designated location
4. WHEN no output folder is specified THEN the system SHALL save CSV files adjacent to the source Excel file
5. WHEN CSV file already exists THEN the system SHALL create a timestamped version to avoid overwrites

### Requirement 5: Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure the converter behavior through configuration files, so that I can customize processing rules without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuration file exists THEN the system SHALL load settings for folders, confidence threshold, and output preferences
2. WHEN confidence threshold is specified THEN the system SHALL use the configured value instead of default 90%
3. WHEN output folder is configured THEN the system SHALL use it for all generated CSV files
4. WHEN file patterns are specified THEN the system SHALL only process matching Excel files
5. WHEN configuration changes THEN the system SHALL reload settings without restart

### Requirement 6: Logging and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want detailed logging of processing activities, so that I can monitor system performance and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing files THEN the system SHALL log file paths, processing times, and success/failure status
2. WHEN worksheets are analyzed THEN the system SHALL log confidence scores and decision rationale
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error messages with context
4. WHEN CSV files are generated THEN the system SHALL log output file paths and record counts
5. WHEN system starts THEN the system SHALL log configuration summary and monitoring status

### Requirement 7: Service Mode Operation

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to run the converter as a continuous service, so that I can automate file processing without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN service mode is started THEN the system SHALL run continuously until explicitly stopped
2. WHEN service is running THEN the system SHALL monitor all configured directories simultaneously
3. WHEN new Excel files are detected THEN the system SHALL automatically process them through the full pipeline
4. WHEN SIGINT or SIGTERM signals are received THEN the system SHALL shutdown gracefully
5. WHEN service is running THEN the system SHALL provide periodic statistics reports
6. WHEN multiple files are detected THEN the system SHALL process them concurrently up to configured limits

### Requirement 8: CLI Interface with Multiple Modes

**User Story:** As a user, I want multiple ways to interact with the converter, so that I can choose the best mode for my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using service command THEN the system SHALL start continuous monitoring mode
2. WHEN using process command THEN the system SHALL process a single specified file
3. WHEN using preview command THEN the system SHALL analyze files without generating CSV output
4. WHEN using stats command THEN the system SHALL display current processing statistics
5. WHEN using config-check command THEN the system SHALL validate and display current configuration
6. WHEN invalid commands are used THEN the system SHALL provide helpful error messages and usage information

## Non-Functional Requirements

# Coverage Improvement to 90%+ Requirements

## Overview
Systematically increase test coverage from current 42.30% to >90% by creating comprehensive test suites for each Python module in the src/excel_to_csv directory.

## Current Coverage Status (Baseline)
- **Overall Coverage**: 42.30%
- **Config manager**: 87.50% âœ… (needs minor improvement)
- **Data models**: 68.60% (needs 21.4% improvement)  
- **Confidence analyzer**: 68.82% (needs 21.18% improvement)
- **CSV generator**: 62.75% (needs 27.25% improvement)
- **CLI**: 38.71% (needs 51.29% improvement)
- **Logger**: 35.71% (needs 54.29% improvement)
- **Main**: 23.08% (needs 66.92% improvement)
- **Excel processor**: 13.47% (needs 76.53% improvement)
- **Excel converter**: 13.43% (needs 76.57% improvement)
- **File monitor**: 10.90% (needs 79.1% improvement)
- **Archive manager**: 8.52% (needs 81.48% improvement)

## Target Requirements

### Primary Modules (High Impact)
1. **excel_to_csv_converter.py** - 263 statements, 13.43% coverage
2. **file_monitor.py** - 228 statements, 10.90% coverage
3. **confidence_analyzer.py** - 283 statements, 68.82% coverage
4. **csv_generator.py** - 187 statements, 62.75% coverage
5. **excel_processor.py** - 153 statements, 13.47% coverage

### Secondary Modules (Medium Impact)
6. **cli.py** - 160 statements, 38.71% coverage
7. **config_manager.py** - 146 statements, 87.50% coverage
8. **logger.py** - 126 statements, 35.71% coverage
9. **archive_manager.py** - 124 statements, 8.52% coverage
10. **data_models.py** - 220 statements, 68.60% coverage

### Tertiary Modules (Low Impact)
11. **main.py** - 11 statements, 23.08% coverage

## Success Criteria
- Each module must achieve >90% test coverage
- All existing tests must continue to pass
- New tests must follow existing test patterns and conventions
- Tests must be meaningful (not just coverage-padding)
- Overall project coverage must exceed 90%

## Quality Standards
- Tests should cover both happy path and error conditions
- Edge cases and boundary conditions must be tested
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Include docstrings for test methods
- Use descriptive test method names

## Constraints
- Do not modify existing working tests
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Follow existing code style and conventions
- Use existing test fixtures and utilities where possible
- Tests should be fast and reliable

## Dependencies
- pytest framework
- pytest-cov for coverage measurement  
- pytest-mock for mocking
- All existing project dependencies

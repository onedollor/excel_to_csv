# Detailed Logging Enhancement Requirements

## Overview
Enhance the logging system to provide comprehensive, detailed logging of every action and result throughout the Excel-to-CSV conversion process. This will enable thorough analysis and debugging by providing complete audit trails of all operations.

## Current Logging Status
- Basic logging exists in most modules
- Limited detail in action outcomes
- Inconsistent logging levels and formats
- Missing correlation IDs for tracking operations across components
- Insufficient error context and recovery information

## Detailed Logging Requirements

### 1. Operation-Level Logging
**Every significant action must be logged with detailed context:**

#### File Processing Operations:
- File detection with metadata (size, modification time, path)
- File validation results with specific reasons for pass/fail
- Excel processing start/completion with timing
- Worksheet extraction details (count, names, sizes)
- Confidence analysis results per worksheet with scoring breakdown
- CSV generation attempts and outcomes
- Archiving operations with source/destination paths
- Error conditions with full context and recovery actions

#### System Operations:
- Service startup/shutdown with configuration details
- File monitor initialization and folder scan results
- Thread pool creation and task submissions
- Queue operations (add/remove/process)
- Configuration loading and validation
- Memory and performance metrics

### 2. Correlation and Tracing
**Track operations across the entire pipeline:**

- **Correlation IDs**: Unique identifier for each file processing operation
- **Request tracing**: Track operations from file detection through completion
- **Component boundaries**: Log entry/exit points between components
- **State transitions**: Log all status changes (pending → processing → completed)

### 3. Performance and Metrics Logging
**Detailed performance tracking:**

- Processing duration per operation (file, worksheet, CSV generation)
- Memory usage before/after major operations
- Queue sizes and processing backlogs
- Throughput metrics (files/minute, worksheets/hour)
- Resource utilization (threads, disk space, memory)

### 4. Business Logic Detail Logging
**Comprehensive business rule execution logging:**

#### Confidence Analysis:
- Input data characteristics (rows, columns, data types)
- Each confidence factor calculation with weights
- Decision thresholds and comparisons
- Final confidence scores and acceptance/rejection reasons

#### CSV Generation:
- Output format decisions and configurations
- Filename generation logic and conflict resolution
- Encoding and formatting choices
- File writing operations with success confirmation

#### Archiving Logic:
- Archive path determination and folder creation
- Conflict detection and timestamp generation
- File movement operations with atomic transaction details
- Structure preservation decisions

### 5. Error and Exception Logging
**Comprehensive error tracking:**

- Full exception stack traces with context
- Error categorization (transient, permanent, configuration)
- Recovery attempt logging with outcomes
- Retry logic execution with backoff timings
- Fallback mechanism activation
- Error aggregation and pattern detection

### 6. Audit and Compliance Logging
**Complete audit trail:**

- User actions and configuration changes
- Data access and processing permissions
- File modifications and movements
- Security-related events
- Compliance checkpoint validations

## Logging Levels and Granularity

### TRACE Level (Most Detailed):
- Function entry/exit with parameters
- Variable state changes
- Loop iterations and condition evaluations
- Memory allocations and releases

### DEBUG Level:
- Algorithm decision points
- Configuration value usage
- Intermediate calculation results
- Cache hits/misses and optimizations

### INFO Level:
- Major operation start/completion
- Business process milestones
- Summary statistics and metrics
- User-facing status updates

### WARN Level:
- Non-fatal errors and recoverable issues
- Performance degradation warnings
- Configuration conflicts or suboptimal settings
- Resource usage thresholds exceeded

### ERROR Level:
- Operation failures requiring intervention
- Data corruption or processing errors
- System resource exhaustion
- Configuration errors preventing operation

## Structured Logging Format

### Log Entry Structure:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2023-12-25T14:30:45.123Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "correlation_id": "proc_20231225_143045_abc123",
  "component": "excel_processor",
  "operation": "process_file",
  "message": "Successfully processed Excel file",
  "context": {
    "file_path": "/input/data.xlsx",
    "file_size_mb": 2.5,
    "worksheets_found": 3,
    "worksheets_processed": 2,
    "processing_duration_ms": 1250,
    "memory_used_mb": 45.2
  },
  "metadata": {
    "thread_id": "ExcelProcessor-1",
    "session_id": "service_session_001",
    "config_version": "1.2.3"
  }
}
```

## Output Destinations

### 1. File Logging:
- **Main log file**: All operations with rotation
- **Error log file**: Errors and warnings only
- **Audit log file**: Security and compliance events
- **Performance log file**: Metrics and timing data

### 2. Console Logging:
- **Service mode**: Summary information only
- **CLI mode**: Detailed progress and results
- **Debug mode**: Full trace information

### 3. Structured Output:
- **JSON format**: For log aggregation systems
- **CSV format**: For analysis and reporting
- **Metrics format**: For monitoring systems integration

## Configuration and Control

### Logging Configuration:
```yaml
logging:
  level: INFO
  detailed_operations: true
  correlation_tracking: true
  performance_metrics: true
  structured_format: true
  
  outputs:
    file:
      enabled: true
      path: "/var/log/excel-to-csv/"
      rotation:
        max_size_mb: 100
        max_files: 10
    console:
      enabled: true
      format: "human_readable"

# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The file archiving feature provides automated organization and management of processed Excel files by moving them to designated archive folders after successful conversion to CSV format. This feature addresses the common need to maintain processed files for audit trails, backup purposes, and workspace organization while preventing re-processing of already converted files.

The archiving system creates an "archive" subfolder within each monitored input directory and automatically moves Excel files to these archive locations upon successful processing. This approach maintains the original directory structure while clearly separating processed from unprocessed files.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature directly supports several key objectives from the product vision:

- **Operational Efficiency**: Eliminates manual file organization tasks and prevents duplicate processing of the same Excel files, improving overall workflow efficiency
- **System Reliability**: Provides clear visual indication of processing status and maintains audit trails of processed files
- **Automation over Manual Intervention**: Reduces required human interaction for file management while maintaining transparency about file processing status
- **Scalability**: Enables processing of large volumes of Excel files without manual cleanup, supporting the 1000+ files per day target

The feature aligns with the "Configuration over Hardcoding" principle by making archiving behavior configurable, and supports the "Transparency over Black Box" principle by providing clear file organization that shows processing history.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want processed Excel files to be automatically moved to an archive folder, so that I can easily distinguish between files that have been processed and those that are waiting for processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an Excel file is successfully processed and CSV files are generated THEN the system SHALL move the Excel file to an "archive" subfolder within the same monitored directory
2. IF the archive folder does not exist THEN the system SHALL create it automatically with appropriate permissions
3. WHEN moving a file to the archive folder AND a file with the same name already exists THEN the system SHALL append a timestamp to avoid filename conflicts
4. IF the Excel file cannot be moved due to permission issues THEN the system SHALL log an error but continue processing other files
5. WHEN the archiving process fails THEN the system SHALL not delete the original Excel file

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure whether file archiving is enabled or disabled, so that I can adapt the system behavior to different organizational policies and storage requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN archiving is disabled in configuration THEN processed Excel files SHALL remain in their original locations
2. IF archiving is enabled THEN the system SHALL create archive folders and move files as specified in Requirement 1
3. WHEN configuration is changed from disabled to enabled THEN the system SHALL apply the new behavior to subsequently processed files without requiring restart
4. IF no archiving configuration is specified THEN the system SHALL default to archiving enabled

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want the system to log archiving operations, so that I can monitor file movement and troubleshoot any issues with file organization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a file is successfully archived THEN the system SHALL log the source and destination file paths at INFO level
2. WHEN archiving fails THEN the system SHALL log the error details and file path at ERROR level
3. WHEN an archive folder is created THEN the system SHALL log the folder creation at INFO level
4. IF a filename conflict occurs during archiving THEN the system SHALL log the conflict resolution (timestamp appending) at WARNING level

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a business intelligence team member, I want archived files to maintain their original names with optional timestamps, so that I can easily correlate archived Excel files with their generated CSV outputs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN archiving a file without naming conflicts THEN the system SHALL preserve the original filename
2. IF a naming conflict occurs THEN the system SHALL append a timestamp in the format "_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS" before the file extension
3. WHEN generating timestamp suffixes THEN the system SHALL use the current system time in UTC
4. IF multiple conflicts occur within the same second THEN the system SHALL append additional numeric suffixes (e.g., "_20241201_143022_001")

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Create a dedicated ArchiveManager class responsible only for file archiving operations
- **Modular Design**: Implement archiving as a separate service that can be easily enabled/disabled and tested independently
- **Dependency Management**: Minimize coupling between archiving functionality and core Excel processing logic
- **Clear Interfaces**: Define a clean contract for post-processing operations that can be extended for future features

### Performance
- **Processing Impact**: File archiving operations SHALL not increase total processing time by more than 5%
- **Concurrent Operations**: Archiving SHALL support concurrent file operations without blocking Excel processing
- **Large File Handling**: The system SHALL efficiently handle archiving of Excel files up to 500MB
- **Network Drive Support**: Archiving SHALL work reliably on network drives with appropriate retry mechanisms

### Security
- **File Permissions**: Archive folders SHALL inherit the permissions of their parent directories
- **Path Validation**: All archive paths SHALL be validated to prevent directory traversal attacks
- **Access Control**: The system SHALL respect existing file system access controls and fail gracefully when permissions are insufficient
- **Audit Trail**: Archive operations SHALL be logged with sufficient detail for security auditing

### Reliability
- **Error Recovery**: Failed archive operations SHALL not corrupt or delete source Excel files
- **Atomicity**: File move operations SHALL be atomic to prevent partial file transfers
- **Retry Logic**: Temporary failures (locked files, network issues) SHALL trigger retry attempts with exponential backoff
- **Graceful Degradation**: If archiving fails, the system SHALL continue processing other files and CSV generation SHALL remain unaffected

### Usability
- **Configuration Simplicity**: Archiving SHALL be controllable via a single boolean configuration option
- **Intuitive Organization**: Archive folder structure SHALL mirror the original directory organization
- **Status Transparency**: Log messages SHALL clearly indicate archiving status and any issues encountered
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing installations SHALL work unchanged with archiving disabled by default until explicitly enabled

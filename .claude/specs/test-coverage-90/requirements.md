# Requirements Document - 90% Test Coverage Achievement

## Introduction

This requirements document defines the comprehensive test coverage enhancement needed to achieve and maintain 90% test coverage across the Excel-to-CSV converter project. The project currently has 35.21% coverage (954/2710 statements) and requires significant test expansion to reach the target 90% coverage (2439/2710 statements), requiring coverage of an additional 1485 statements.

The enhanced test coverage will ensure code reliability, maintainability, and quality assurance for all critical business logic and edge cases in the Excel-to-CSV conversion system.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This initiative directly supports the project's reliability and quality goals by:
- Ensuring comprehensive validation of all Excel processing workflows
- Providing confidence in file conversion accuracy and error handling
- Enabling safe refactoring and feature enhancements through comprehensive test coverage
- Supporting continuous integration/deployment with automated quality gates

### Requirement 2: Comprehensive Test Case Development

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want detailed test cases covering all code paths and edge scenarios, so that the system behaves predictably under all operational conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing Config Manager tests THEN the test suite SHALL include configuration loading, validation, environment overrides, error handling, and caching scenarios
2. WHEN creating Excel Processor tests THEN the suite SHALL cover file reading, format validation, size limits, corruption handling, multi-sheet processing, and memory management
3. WHEN implementing CSV Generator tests THEN the suite SHALL validate file creation, naming patterns, encoding options, duplicate handling, and concurrent generation
4. WHEN building Excel Converter tests THEN the suite SHALL test workflow orchestration, error recovery, statistics collection, and performance monitoring
5. WHEN developing Archive Manager tests THEN the suite SHALL cover file archiving, compression, cleanup, retention policies, and storage management
6. WHEN creating File Monitor tests THEN the suite SHALL test event detection, debouncing, pattern matching, and concurrent file handling
7. WHEN implementing CLI tests THEN the suite SHALL validate argument parsing, command execution, help display, error reporting, and signal handling

### Requirement 3: Edge Case and Error Scenario Coverage

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive error handling validation, so that the system gracefully handles all failure scenarios without data loss or system instability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing file operations THEN all modules SHALL have test coverage for file permission errors, disk space exhaustion, and network interruptions
2. WHEN validating data processing THEN tests SHALL cover malformed Excel files, empty worksheets, oversized files, and corrupted data scenarios
3. WHEN testing concurrent operations THEN the suite SHALL validate thread safety, resource contention, and deadlock prevention
4. WHEN validating memory usage THEN tests SHALL cover large file processing, memory leak detection, and resource cleanup
5. WHEN testing configuration scenarios THEN the suite SHALL cover invalid configurations, missing environment variables, and default fallback behavior

### Requirement 4: Integration and End-to-End Testing Enhancement

**User Story:** As a product owner, I want comprehensive integration testing, so that all system components work together seamlessly in real-world scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running integration tests THEN the test suite SHALL validate complete file processing workflows from input to output
2. WHEN testing service mode THEN integration tests SHALL cover continuous monitoring, automatic processing, and graceful shutdown
3. WHEN validating multi-file scenarios THEN tests SHALL cover concurrent processing, batch operations, and resource management
4. WHEN testing CLI integration THEN the suite SHALL validate command-line workflows, configuration loading, and output formatting
5. WHEN validating performance scenarios THEN tests SHALL cover large file processing (50MB+), memory usage patterns, and processing time benchmarks

### Requirement 5: Automated Coverage Enforcement

**User Story:** As a development team lead, I want automated coverage enforcement, so that code quality standards are maintained consistently across all development activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running automated tests THEN the CI/CD pipeline SHALL enforce minimum 90% coverage threshold and fail builds below this target
2. WHEN submitting code changes THEN pre-commit hooks SHALL validate coverage requirements before allowing commits

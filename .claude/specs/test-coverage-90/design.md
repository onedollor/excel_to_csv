# Design Document - 90% Test Coverage Achievement

## Overview

This design document outlines the comprehensive implementation approach for achieving and maintaining 90% test coverage across the Excel-to-CSV converter project. The current coverage stands at 35.21% (954/2710 statements), requiring coverage of an additional 1485 statements to reach the 90% target (2439/2710 statements).

The design focuses on systematic testing enhancement for seven critical modules: Config Manager, Excel Processor, CSV Generator, Excel Converter, Archive Manager, File Monitor, and CLI. The approach leverages existing successful test patterns from high-coverage modules (System Prompt Loader: 100%, Logger: 87%) while implementing comprehensive testing strategies for complex file I/O operations, async processing, and component integration.

## Steering Document Alignment

### Technical Standards (tech.md)

The design follows documented technical patterns and standards:
- **Python 3.11+ Standards**: Utilizes modern type hints, improved performance features, and pytest framework (>= 7.0.0)
- **Testing Framework**: Builds on established pytest ecosystem with fixtures and parametrization support
- **Code Quality**: Implements pytest-cov (>= 4.0.0) for coverage reporting with HTML output capabilities
- **Architecture Patterns**: Follows event-driven pipeline architecture with modular component design
- **Performance Requirements**: Test execution completes within 5 minutes; coverage reports generate within 30 seconds

### Project Structure (structure.md)

Implementation follows project organization conventions:
- **Test Structure**: Mirrors src layout with tests/ directory containing unit/, integration/, and performance/ subdirectories
- **Naming Conventions**: Uses snake_case for test modules (test_excel_processor.py) and PascalCase for test classes (TestExcelProcessor)
- **Import Patterns**: Follows PEP 8 ordering with explicit imports and proper module boundaries
- **Documentation Standards**: Implements Google-style docstrings with comprehensive type hints

## Code Reuse Analysis

### Existing Components to Leverage

- **Successful Test Patterns**: Adopts patterns from high-coverage modules including comprehensive mocking strategies and edge case coverage
- **Testing Utilities**: Utilizes existing test helper functions for file creation, data validation, and environment setup
- **Coverage Infrastructure**: Builds upon existing pytest-cov configuration and reporting mechanisms

### Integration Points

- **pytest Framework**: Integrates with existing test runner configuration and fixture management
- **Coverage Reporting**: Connects to established coverage analysis pipeline with HTML, XML, and terminal output formats
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Leverages existing automated testing infrastructure with coverage threshold enforcement
- **Mock Strategies**: Extends current mocking approaches for file system operations and external dependencies

## Architecture

The testing architecture implements a comprehensive multi-layered approach designed to achieve systematic coverage improvement across all critical modules:

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing

**Approach:** Comprehensive isolated component testing with extensive mocking

- **Key Components:** All seven critical modules with focus on business logic and edge cases
- **Mock Strategy:** File system operations, external dependencies, configuration loading
- **Test Categories:** Happy path, error scenarios, boundary conditions, performance limits

**Implementation Pattern:**
```python
class TestConfigManager:
    """Comprehensive Config Manager testing."""
    
    @pytest.fixture
    def mock_file_system(self):
        """Mock file system operations."""
        with patch('pathlib.Path.exists'), patch('pathlib.Path.read_text'):
            yield
    
    def test_config_loading_success(self, mock_file_system, sample_config_dict):
        """Test successful configuration loading."""
        # Implementation with comprehensive assertions
        pass
    
    @pytest.mark.parametrize("error_type", [FileNotFoundError, PermissionError, yaml.YAMLError])
    def test_config_loading_errors(self, error_type):
        """Test error handling in configuration loading."""
        # Error scenario validation
        pass
```

### Integration Testing

**Approach:** Component interaction validation with realistic data flows
- **End-to-End Workflows:** Complete file processing from input to output
- **Service Integration:** CLI to converter to processor workflows  
- **Configuration Integration:** Environment variables to YAML to runtime configuration
- **Performance Integration:** Large file processing with memory monitoring

**Key Flows:**
- File monitoring → Excel processing → CSV generation → Archive management
- CLI command → Configuration loading → Batch processing → Result reporting
- Error injection → Recovery mechanisms → State consistency validation

### End-to-End Testing

**Approach:** Complete system validation with realistic operational scenarios
- **User Scenarios:** Command-line workflows, service mode operations, batch processing
- **Performance Benchmarks:** Large file processing (50MB+), concurrent operations (5+ files)
- **Resource Management:** Memory usage patterns, disk space utilization, cleanup verification
- **Error Recovery:** System resilience under various failure conditions

**Test Categories:**
- Single file conversion workflows
- Batch processing scenarios
- Continuous monitoring operations
- Error recovery and system restoration

### Performance Testing Framework

**Load Testing Implementation:**
```python

    """Performance and load testing for coverage validation."""
    
    @pytest.mark.performance
    @pytest.mark.parametrize("file_size", [1, 5, 25, 50])  # MB
    def test_large_file_processing(self, file_size):
        """Validate processing performance across file sizes."""
        # Memory monitoring, timing analysis, resource usage
        pass
    
    @pytest.mark.performance
    @pytest.mark.parametrize("concurrent_files", [1, 5, 10, 20])

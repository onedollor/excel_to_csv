# Implementation Plan - 90% Test Coverage Achievement

## Task Overview

This implementation plan systematically achieves 90% test coverage across seven critical modules of the Excel-to-CSV converter project. The approach follows a phased implementation strategy, progressing from foundational modules (Config Manager, Excel Processor) through core functionality (CSV Generator, Excel Converter) to system integration components (Archive Manager, File Monitor, CLI). Each phase builds upon previous coverage improvements while targeting specific statement coverage goals to reach the overall 90% target (2439/2710 statements, requiring +1485 additional covered statements).

## Steering Document Compliance

The task breakdown follows established project conventions and technical standards:
- **Python 3.11+ Standards**: Utilizes modern type hints, pytest framework (>= 7.0.0), and performance optimization
- **Testing Architecture**: Implements comprehensive unit, integration, and performance testing layers
- **Code Quality Standards**: Follows pytest-cov (>= 4.0.0) with HTML reporting and CI/CD integration
- **Project Structure**: Maintains tests/ directory organization mirroring src/ layout with proper naming conventions
- **Documentation Standards**: Implements Google-style docstrings with comprehensive type hints and test documentation

## Atomic Task Requirements

**Each task must meet these criteria for optimal agent execution:**
- **File Scope**: Touches 1-3 related files maximum
- **Time Boxing**: Completable in 15-30 minutes
- **Single Purpose**: One testable outcome per task
- **Specific Files**: Must specify exact files to create/modify
- **Agent-Friendly**: Clear input/output with minimal context switching

## Task Format Guidelines

- Use checkbox format: `- [ ] Task number. Task description`
- **Specify files**: Always include exact file paths to create/modify
- **Include implementation details** as bullet points
- Reference requirements using: `_Requirements: X.Y, Z.A_`
- Reference existing code to leverage using: `_Leverage: path/to/file.ts, path/to/component.tsx_`
- Focus only on coding tasks (no deployment, user testing, etc.)
- **Avoid broad terms**: No "system", "integration", "complete" in task titles

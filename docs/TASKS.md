## Detailed Implementation Status

### âœ… **Service Mode Implementation** (Complete)

**Features Implemented:**
```python
# Continuous monitoring service
excel-to-csv service

# Key capabilities:
# â€¢ Real-time directory watching (5-second response)
# â€¢ Concurrent processing (configurable workers)  
# â€¢ Retry logic with exponential backoff
# â€¢ Signal handling (SIGINT/SIGTERM)
# â€¢ Statistics reporting every 5 minutes
# â€¢ Graceful shutdown with cleanup
```

**Architecture:**
- **File Monitor**: watchdog-based cross-platform monitoring
- **Processing Queue**: Thread-safe queue with debouncing
- **Thread Pool**: Configurable concurrent processing
- **Service Orchestrator**: Manages entire service lifecycle

### âœ… **CLI Interface Implementation** (Complete)

**Commands Available:**
```bash
excel-to-csv service                    # Continuous monitoring mode
excel-to-csv process file.xlsx          # Single file processing  
excel-to-csv preview file.xlsx          # Analysis without output
excel-to-csv stats [--watch]           # Processing statistics
excel-to-csv config-check               # Configuration validation
```

**CLI Features:**
- **Multi-mode Operation**: Service vs. one-time processing
- **Interactive Feedback**: Progress indicators and status updates
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages and usage guidance
- **Flexible Configuration**: Custom config file support

### âœ… **Intelligence System** (Complete)

**90% Confidence Analysis:**
- **Data Density Analysis (40%)**: Cell occupancy and clustering patterns
- **Header Quality Assessment (30%)**: Pattern matching and validation
- **Data Consistency Scoring (30%)**: Column type consistency analysis

**Decision Logic:**
```python
# Confidence scoring with detailed reasoning
confidence_score = analyzer.analyze_worksheet(worksheet)
if confidence_score.overall_score >= 0.90:
    # Process and generate CSV
    csv_generator.generate_csv(worksheet, config)
else:
    # Skip with logged reasons
    logger.info(f"Rejected: {confidence_score.reasons}")
```

### ðŸ”„ **Testing Layer** (In Progress)

**Testing Strategy:**
- **Unit Tests**: Individual component testing with mocks
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflow validation  
- **Performance Tests**: Large file handling verification
- **Coverage Tests**: 90% code coverage requirement

**Test Categories:**
```python
# Configuration management tests
tests/config/test_config_manager.py

# Excel processing tests  
tests/processors/test_excel_processor.py

# Confidence analysis tests
tests/analysis/test_confidence_analyzer.py

# CSV generation tests
tests/generators/test_csv_generator.py

# File monitoring tests
tests/monitoring/test_file_monitor.py

# End-to-end integration tests
tests/integration/test_end_to_end.py
```

## Service Mode Operational Flow

### 1. Service Startup Sequence
```
1. Load configuration (YAML + environment overrides)
2. Initialize logging system (console + file + JSON)
3. Create processing components (processor, analyzer, generator)
4. Set up signal handlers (SIGINT, SIGTERM)
5. Start thread pool (configurable workers)
6. Initialize file monitor with configured directories
7. Scan existing files for initial processing
8. Enter main service loop (runs until shutdown)
```

### 2. File Processing Pipeline
```
File Detected â†’ Queue â†’ Thread Pool â†’ Excel Process â†’ Confidence Analysis â†’ CSV Generate
      â†“              â†“         â†“            â†“               â†“                â†“
   Debounce      Thread     Worksheet   90% Threshold    Safe Filename    Success
   (2 sec)       Safe       Extraction   Decision        Generation       Logging
```

### 3. Error Handling & Retry Logic
```python
# Exponential backoff retry logic
for attempt in range(max_attempts):
    try:
        success = process_file(file_path)
        if success:
            break
    except Exception as e:
        delay = base_delay * (backoff_factor ** attempt)
        time.sleep(min(delay, max_delay))
```

## Configuration System

### Multi-Level Configuration
```yaml
# config/default.yaml
monitoring:
  folders: ["./input", "./data"]
  file_patterns: ["*.xlsx", "*.xls"]
  
confidence:
  threshold: 0.9
  
processing:
  max_concurrent: 5
  
logging:
  level: "INFO"
  file:
    enabled: true
    path: "./logs/excel_to_csv.log"
```

### Environment Override Examples
```bash
# Override confidence threshold
export EXCEL_TO_CSV_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD=0.85

# Override output folder  
export EXCEL_TO_CSV_OUTPUT_FOLDER="/custom/output"

# Override log level
export EXCEL_TO_CSV_LOG_LEVEL="DEBUG"
```
